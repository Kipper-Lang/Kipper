# How to contribute to Kipper

Welcome to the Kipper contribution guide!

This guide aims to explain the basics of Kipper, how to use issues/PRs in Kipper and how to contribute to the 
project and modify the source code.

## Using issues to propose changes

One of the first things that must be done before contributing to Kipper is to open an issue, or look at
existing issues or PRs. 

- In case you are working on someone else's issue or PR, it is important to read through the details of the issue or PR
  and get to know what should be done, and how other people proposed to do it.
- In case you are creating your own issue, it is important to think through how your change matters and what they 
  should do. This is vital for others to understand how to work on your issue and give feedback/recommendations.

### Bug issue

If you are working on or creating a bug issue, it is important to try and recreate the issue using tests or sample 
projects that recreate the situation that the bug was encountered in.

In case you are creating a bug issue it is also important to provide steps on how to reproduce the issue and info about 
your environment. The [bug issue template](https://github.com/Luna-Klatzer/Kipper/issues/new/choose) will help you 
with that.

### Feature issue

If you are working on or creating a feature issue, it is important to understand the details behind such a feature 
and its implementation, and write those into the issue or comment such info under the issue.

In case you are creating a feature issue it is also important to provide info on how you implemented it and what
your changes did and will do.
