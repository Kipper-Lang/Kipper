# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please note that considering this is a work-in-progress project with no stable versions released yet,
only the most recent versions will be supported, while older versions will not get updated,
and must be migrated to newer versions to work continuously.

### List of supported versions

The following versions are supported and will get bug-fixes and security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.9.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 0.8.3   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| <0.8.3  | :x:                |

### NPM Deprecation

If a version gets deprecated/loses support, it will be deprecated as well on the NPM registry.
This means the version will be marked as outdated and NPM will provide a deprecation warning to everyone who attempts to
install it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting a vulnerability or issue can be done under
the [issues page](https://github.com/Luna-Klatzer/Kipper/issues/new/choose).
Mark the issue as a bug report, and follow the guidelines inside the issue editor. Be as detailed as possible to avoid
too many followup questions.

Remember when reporting an issue, this project is in active build-up and development, so bug fixes
may take some time to be done and released in new versions.
