## Supported Versions

Note that considering this is a work-in-progress project with no stable version released yet,
only the most recent versions will be supported, while older versions will not get updated,
and must be migrated to newer versions to work continuously.

Currently supported versions that will receive updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.5   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.0.5 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting a vulnerability or issue can be done under the [issues page](https://github.com/Luna-Klatzer/Kipper/issues/new/choose). 
Mark the issue as a bug report, and follow the guidelines inside the issue editor. Be as detailed as possible to avoid too many
followup questions.

Remember though when reporting an issue, this project is in build-up and development, so it will almost definitely not be a high priority for development.
