# Overview - Statements

Statements form the basis of Kipper next to [expressions](../expressions/index.html), and perform the basic
operations and define the logic in your program. They can be easily identified with their usage of either curly
brackets (`{ }`) or a semicolon (`;`).

Every operation in a Kipper program must be contained in a statement to be valid. This also includes
[expressions](../expressions/index.html), which can never be written alone.
