# Supported platforms

Platforms which Kipper supports and should work with the Kipper Compiler without an issue.

## Node.js Support

All Node.js versions that are above or equal the release `14.0.0` (Fermium) are supported by Kipper.

OS-wise Kipper only actively supports Windows 10/11 and Linux >5.0.0, even if Node.js supports more operating systems.
(Kipper will likely still work on more systems than listed here, but there is no guarantee and no support to fix bugs
if they occur.)
