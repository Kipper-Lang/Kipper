# Goals for Kipper

The goal of Kipper is to provide a simple and easy to learn language, which tries to be as straight-forward and secure
as possible with features, such as:

- Full type safety to ensure errors occur on compile time, not runtime.
- Runtime types and type checking, which allow variable types to be checked during runtime, if their type can not be
  evaluated during compile time. For example when using `JSON.parse()`.
- Runtime errors for invalid operations. No hidden errors like in JavaScript.
- Null safety, by enforcing non-null types unless explicitly allowed.
- Full translation and integration with JavaScript and TypeScript.
