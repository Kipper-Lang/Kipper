# Arithmetic Expression

Arithmetic expressions are simple mathematical calculations, where a numeric result is returned after the expression
was evaluated. They may also be chained based on their order of precedence, where each item is one by one evaluated.

## Syntax

```ts
EXP ( + | - | * | / | ** | % ) EXP
```

## Examples

```ts
// Plus
400.3 + 26.3; // -> 426.6

// Minus
87 - 2.5; // -> 84.5

// Multiply
2.4 * 5; // -> 12

// Divide
25 / 4; // -> 6.25

// Power to
2 ** 8; // -> 256

// Rest of Divide
51 % 10; // -> 1
```
