# Kipper Module API

The Kipper Module API describes the functionality of the core Kipper compiler, which is provided by the `@kipper/core`
package and its sibling packages `@kipper/target-js` and `@kipper/target-ts`. This is besides the
[Kipper CLI API](../cli/index.html) the only way to interact with the Kipper compiler.

Unlike the CLI API, the Module API can be interacted with using code. This is done by importing the `@kipper/core`
package, which can be added to your local project dependencies (Go to the section
[`Importing Kipper as a module` in the Quickstart Guide](../../quickstart.html#importing-kipper-as-a-module) for more
info on how to do this).

<p>
The API docs are a work-in-progress and will be slowly, but surely realised with the development of Kipper.
As such this part of the docs is not fully realised yet, and will be updated in the future.
