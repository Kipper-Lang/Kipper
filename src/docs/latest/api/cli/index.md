# Kipper CLI API

The Kipper CLI API describes the functionality of the Kipper CLI, which is provided by the `@kipper/cli` package. This
is besides the [Kipper Module API](../module/index.html) the only way to interact with the Kipper compiler.

Unlike the programmatic API, the CLI can be interacted with using the command line. This is done by calling commands
and flags to the `kipper` command, which is per default available in your package or globally when the `@kipper/cli`
package is installed.

<p>
The API docs are a work-in-progress and will be slowly, but surely realised with the development of Kipper.
As such this part of the docs is not fully realised yet, and will be updated in the future.
