# Undefined Type - `undefined`

The `undefined` type represents a value that is nothing and may only be `undefined`. It is used to indicate that a variable
does not have a value or that an object does not exist.

<div class="important">
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>
Due to unions not being implemented yet, it is not possible to use the undefined type in combination with other types.
Meaning that at the moment, its practical usage is fairly limited.
