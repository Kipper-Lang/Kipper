# Null Type - `null`

The null type is a special type that represents the absence of a value. It is used to indicate that a variable does not
have a value or that an object does not exist.

<div class="important">
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>
Due to unions not being implemented yet, it is not possible to use the null type in combination with other types.
Meaning that at the moment, its practical usage is fairly limited.

</div>

## Examples

### Simple null variable definitions

var var1: null = null;
