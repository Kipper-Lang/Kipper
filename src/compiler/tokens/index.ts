/**
 * The submodule containing the Kipper parse tokens, which implement the antlr4 parse tree and context instances. This
 * module adds extended functionality for the tokens, allowing semantic analysis and compilation.
 *
 * In comparison to the antlr4 generated parser tokens, these tokens will only contain the necessary items of
 * Kipper, to simplify the compilation process and allow for simplified checking. This also means many syntax characters
 * are omitted.
