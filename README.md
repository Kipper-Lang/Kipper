# Kipper
The Kipper Programming Language

## Project Overview
- NodeJS is used for the deployment and usage of the project.
- [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is used for the versioning of new releases.
- CHANGELOG.md uses the format from [KeepAChangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
- [Antrl4](https://antlr.org) is used for generating the lexer and parser for the language.

## Website Project and online Compiler Project

Since this project is intended as a learning task for TypeScript and Web-Dev, the project will have an interactive website
and the compiler built in for simple usage online without having to install the project.

## Language Grammar

The grammar files can be found in `./grammar/`. The files are in the Antlr4-Format and will be used with the Antlr4 compiled
TypeScript Parser and Lexer.
