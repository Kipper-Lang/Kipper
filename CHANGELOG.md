## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Basic `run` command for running a compiled file or compiling and running a file. (This is still in development).
- Basic `compile` command for compiling a file into it's js-counterpart with its typescript types added.
- New Parse Stream class `KipperParseStream`, which implements a basic Utf-16 stream.
- Support for `[]` initializers for lists in Kipper.g4.
- Support for `multiItemTypeSpecifier`, which use the `identifier<T>` syntax (for lists specifically).
- Support for `typeof(V)` (`typeofTypeSpecifier`) syntax for `typeSpecifier` expressions.
- Support for Kipper-Conversion `identifier as typeSpecifier` syntax.
- Support for for-loops using the `for(INIT_EXPRESSION; CONDITION, LOOP_EXPRESSION) STATEMENT` syntax.

### Changed
- Made `KipperParseFile` inherit from `KipperParseStream` and made it be a specific interface for files alone, while
  `KipperParseStream` handles raw string data.

### Changed
